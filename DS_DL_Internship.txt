Day 1:
Setup Day

Day 2: Data Strategies
- Python Venv Setup and Implementation
- Jupyter notebook setup in Day Folder
- Dataset Importing
- Data Imputation
- Label Encoding
- One Hot Encoding

Day 3: Machine Learning
- Types of Analysis: Descriptive and Predictive
- Understanding Predictive Analysis with Examples
- Understanding Supervised and Unsupervised Learning (Solving Seen/Known[Supervised] and Unknown[Unsupervised] Problems)
- A/B Testing: Train and Test (Comparison in Supervised and Unsupervised)
--	90/10 Data Rule in  Train and Test Data (Supervised) [Ability to derive an answer based on trained data question]
---		Contains answer for all questions when trained
--	60/40 Data Rule in Train and Test  Data (Unsupervised) [Deriving answer from a certain pattern]
---		Regression:
----			Ability to predict continuous values
---		Classification:
----			Ability to predict discrete values
- Understanding Regression: Parametric and Non-parametric
--	Parametric: Linear, Linear discriminate Analysis (Traceable Method of Prediction)
--	Non-Parametric: RandomFirst, k-neighbor, SVR, QDA (Non-Traceable Method of Prediction)
- Understanding Parametric Regression: Linear Regression
--	Tracing a Common Line that could represent all points in a data, thereby plotting a linear function
--	y = a + bx + e (Known: x,y)(Unknown: a,b)(e: Error)
--	Implementation using Python
- Understanding Multi-Linear Regression [Least Squares Method] (Find Video Examples)
--	y^ = ÃŸ^
-- 	((X^T . X )^-1 . X^T) . y [Where X is a matrix of all Columns]
